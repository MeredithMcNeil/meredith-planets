As you know, I thought The Martian was a top night out.
He did eat potatoes grown in "human waste".
I thought he was going to make it in the last bit.
I was on the edge of my seat.
Science was the hero, but no one really plugs a laptop into a supercomputer the way it was done in the movie.
At least there was a happy ending.
